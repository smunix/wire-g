# [wire-g][]

My attempt to implement an Functional Reactive Programming framework. 

Start working on your project with the Stack commands
you know and love.

``` sh
# Build the project.
stack build

# Run the test suite.
stack test

# Run the benchmarks.
stack bench

# Generate documentation.
stack haddock
```

Thanks, and happy hacking!
